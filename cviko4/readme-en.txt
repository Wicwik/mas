we deals with two implementations of multi-agent system with indirect communication
- built over web services
- built over the TCP and the native Java marshalling 

work in indirect-ws

The web services exercise has for parts: 1, 2, 3, 4 
Please deals with them gradually.

The part 3 is not directly related, it presents how any web service can be implemented.
The part 4 employs employs also the server part, which you just employs, its implemetation
can be seen in the subdirectory tomcat7

There is an individual readme in every subdirectory

advanced task: design (do not implement) to the part 4
how to add WebService for blockingRead(). There are more choices how to do that
but in general, no one is very smart, such a service is a big problem for the 
web services concept. It is not required to implement it, just to invent an idea.

homework: indirect-rmi\readme (it can be completed even during training)
